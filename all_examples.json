Overall, the 31-year time difference is a significant factor that shapes the characters' experiences and interactions throughout the story.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the concept of time differ between space and Stevie's home planet?\n\nThe concept of time in space and on Stevie's home planet differs due to the relativistic effects of space travel. While Stevie has been away for 12 years in space, 31 years have passed on her home planet.\n\nThe difference in the passage of time between space and Stevie's home planet is a key element in the story. It contributes to the emotional distance between Stevie and her family, as they have aged and lived through experiences that she has not been a part of. It also adds to the tension and uncertainty of her return, as she does not know what changes have occurred during her absence. Furthermore, this time difference plays a role in the decision-making process for Stevie and her husband Ammo, as they consider whether to stay on the planet or return to space.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what are the implications of the 31-year time difference for Stevie's future?\n\nThe 31-year time difference means that Stevie's family and friends have aged significantly more than she has, and the life she left behind has moved on without her. This could lead to difficulties in reconnecting with her family and adjusting to the changes that have occurred during her absence.\n\nThe time difference is a result of the relativistic effects of space travel, where time passes more slowly for the traveler than for those remaining stationary. This has led to a significant age gap between Stevie and her family, and the world she left behind has changed over the decades. This is further complicated by the fact that her husband Ammo has decided to stay on the planet, causing a rift between them. The time difference also means that if Stevie decides to leave again, she may have to wait a long time before another ship arrives due to the infrequent visits by space tramps to her system.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 31-year time difference contribute to the story's conflict?\n\nThe 31-year time difference contributes to the story's conflict by creating a disconnect between Stevie and her family. This time gap exacerbates the tension and misunderstanding between Stevie and her family, particularly her sister Onneli, who is upset that Stevie left without saying goodbye. It also complicates Stevie's relationship with her husband Ammo, who decides to stay on the planet after seeing his hibernating family.\n\nThe time difference is a result of the time dilation effect of space travel, which means that time passes differently for Stevie compared to her family on Blanca. This creates a significant gap in their shared experiences and understanding of each other, leading to conflict and misunderstanding. For instance, Onneli is upset that Stevie left without saying goodbye and is skeptical of Ammo. Furthermore, the time difference makes Ammo's decision to stay on the planet more impactful, as it means he is choosing to leave Stevie and the life they had together on the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 31-year time difference influence Stevie's perception of her home planet?\n\nThe 31-year time difference makes Stevie apprehensive about returning to her home planet. She is unsure about the changes that might have occurred during her absence and whether her family is still alive.\n\nThe time difference is a result of the time dilation effect of space travel, where time passes differently for those traveling at near-light speeds compared to those who remain stationary. This has led to a significant gap between Stevie's personal timeline and that of her family and home planet. This gap has created uncertainty and apprehension for Stevie, as she does not know what to expect upon her return. It also influences her decision-making process throughout the story, such as her decision to leave without Ammo and her eventual choice to stay with him.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why does Ang Wong estimate an 80% chance of crew members returning to the space tramp after visiting their home planets?\n\nAng Wong estimates an 80% chance of crew members returning to the space tramp after visiting their home planets because, according to her, people who have a happy home life don't sign up on a space tramp in the first place. Additionally, she mentions that it's written into the tramp constitution that crew members can visit their home planets, and just knowing they could is enough for most. Even if they do try to stay, most of the time it doesn't work out.\n\nThe fact that Ang Wong estimates an 80% chance of crew members returning to the space tramp after visiting their home planets is related to the overall theme of the story, which is about the struggle of returning home after a long time away. It also foreshadows the conflict that Stevie and Ammo face later in the story when Ammo decides to stay on the planet, causing Stevie to initially decide to leave without him. This fact also highlights the transient nature of life on a space tramp and the difficulties of readjusting to life on a home planet after being away for so long.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the significance of the 80% estimate in relation to Stevie's decision to return home?\n\nThe 80% estimate signifies the likelihood that Stevie will return to the space tramp after visiting her home planet.\n\nThe estimate is significant because it reflects the general trend among space tramp crew members who visit their home planets. Despite the emotional pull of home, the majority of crew members choose to return to the space tramp. This statistic is relevant to Stevie's situation as she is torn between her life on the space tramp and her family back home. The fact that most crew members return to the space tramp might influence her decision about whether to stay on her home planet or return to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 80% estimate affect Stevie's perception of her chances of returning to the space tramp?\n\nThe 80% estimate given by Ang Wong does not seem to significantly affect Stevie's perception of her chances of returning to the space tramp. Despite this high probability, she ultimately decides to stay on the planet with Ammo.\n\nThe 80% estimate given by Ang Wong is meant to indicate that the majority of crew members who visit their home planets end up returning to the space tramp. However, this statistic does not seem to influence Stevie's decision. Despite knowing that most crew members return, Stevie chooses to stay on the planet with Ammo. This decision is influenced more by her personal circumstances and feelings, rather than the statistical probability of her returning to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what factors contribute to the 80% chance of crew members returning to the space tramp?\n\nThe factors that contribute to the 80% chance of crew members returning to the space tramp include the dissatisfaction with their previous home life, the mandatory rule written into the tramp constitution that allows crew members to visit their home planets, and the fact that most attempts to stay at home don't work out. Additionally, the infrequent visits of the tramp to certain systems may also contribute to the crew members' decision to return.\n\nAng Wong explains that people who have a happy home life usually don't sign up on a space tramp in the first place, implying that many crew members, like Stevie, left their home planets due to dissatisfaction with their previous lives. The mandatory rule allowing crew members to visit their home planets gives them the freedom to return if they wish, but knowing they have this option is often enough for most. Furthermore, most attempts to stay at home don't work out, as exemplified by the case of Gar Han Wang, who decided to leave again after only two months. Lastly, the infrequency of tramp visits to certain systems means that if crew members decide to stay and then change their minds, they might have to wait a long time for another tramp to arrive, which could deter them from staying on their home planets.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 80% estimate relate to the mandatory rule written into the tramp constitution?\n\nThe 80% estimate given by Ang Wong relates to the mandatory rule written into the tramp constitution in that it reflects the likelihood of crew members returning to the space tramp after visiting their home planets. The rule allows crew members to visit their home planets, with the understanding that most of them will choose to return to the space tramp.\n\nThe mandatory rule in the tramp constitution allows crew members to visit their home planets, which is a right that most crew members value even if they don't exercise it. The 80% estimate given by Ang Wong is based on past experiences and indicates that the majority of crew members who do visit their home planets eventually choose to return to the space tramp. This suggests that while the opportunity to visit home is important to the crew, the majority of them still prefer the life they have chosen aboard the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the 80% estimate influence Stevie's decision to leave Ammo behind?\n\nNo, the 80% estimate does not influence Stevie's decision to leave Ammo behind.\n\nStevie's decision to leave Ammo behind is influenced by their argument about his decision to stay on the planet without discussing it with her. She is upset that he made such a significant decision without considering her feelings or their shared life. The 80% estimate given by Ang Wong, the ship's resource manager, is a general statistic about crew members who visit their home planets, and there is no indication in the story that this information directly influences Stevie's personal decision about leaving Ammo.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 80% estimate impact Ammo's decision to stay on the planet?\n\nThe 80% estimate does not directly impact Ammo's decision to stay on the planet. His decision is influenced more by his emotional response to seeing his family again, rather than the statistical likelihood of crew members returning to the space tramp.\n\nThe 80% estimate given by Ang Wong is a general statistic for all crew members who visit their home planets. It does not take into account individual circumstances or emotional responses, which are the primary factors influencing Ammo's decision. His emotional response to seeing his family again, coupled with the realization that he wants to come home for good, are what lead him to decide to stay on the planet. The statistic is more relevant to Stevie's situation, as she is part of the 80% who decide to return to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the 80% estimate affect the crew members' perception of their home planets?\n\nThe story does not explicitly state whether the 80% estimate affects the crew members' perception of their home planets.\n\nThe 80% estimate given by Ang Wong is a statistic about the likelihood of crew members returning to the space tramp after visiting their home planets. It is not directly linked to how the crew members perceive their home planets. However, it does suggest that a majority of crew members, despite visiting their home planets, choose to return to the space tramp, indicating that their experiences or circumstances at home may not be as fulfilling or preferable as their life aboard the space tramp. In the case of Stevie and Ammo, their decisions to return or stay are influenced by their personal experiences and emotions during their visit, not by the 80% estimate.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the 80% estimate reflect on the lifestyle aboard the space tramp?\n\nThe 80% estimate reflects that the majority of the crew members aboard the space tramp prefer the lifestyle of space travel over their previous lives on their home planets.\n\nThe fact that 80% of crew members return to the space tramp after visiting their home planets suggests that the lifestyle aboard the space tramp is preferable for these individuals. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the freedom and adventure of space travel, the escape from the constraints of their previous lives, or the camaraderie among the crew. In the case of Stevie, she had left her home planet to escape her parents\u2019 rigidity and the stifling small-town life. Despite the emotional challenges of returning home and the potential allure of staying, the majority of crew members ultimately choose to return to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the 80% estimate play a role in Stevie's final decision to join Ammo in hibernation?\n\nNo, the 80% estimate does not play a role in Stevie's final decision to join Ammo in hibernation.\n\nStevie's decision to join Ammo in hibernation is influenced by her emotional connection to Ammo and her desire to be with him, rather than the statistical likelihood of her returning to the space tramp. The fact that she learns there are no genetic differences between Winters and Summers, and that the seasons are cultural adaptations, also plays a role in her decision. The 80% estimate given by Ang Wong, the ship\u2019s resource manager, is not mentioned as a factor in her decision-making process.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why is it mandatory for crew members of the space tramp to be allowed to visit their home planets?\n\nIt is mandatory for crew members of the space tramp to be allowed to visit their home planets because it is written into the tramp constitution. The idea behind this rule is that just knowing they could return home is enough for most crew members.\n\nThis fact is significant in the story as it provides a reason for Stevie and Ammo's return to their home planet. It also highlights the psychological aspect of space travel, suggesting that the possibility of returning home can be a comfort for crew members who are far away from their home planets for extended periods. Furthermore, it sets up the potential for conflict and emotional turmoil, as returning home after a long time can lead to unexpected changes and decisions, as seen with Ammo's decision to stay on the planet.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how often do crew members of the space tramp typically choose to visit their home planets?\n\nThe story does not provide a specific frequency at which crew members of the space tramp typically choose to visit their home planets.\n\nThe story mentions that crew members are allowed to visit their home planets, but it does not specify how often they typically choose to do so. However, it is mentioned that most crew members do not choose to stay on their home planets after visiting, and those who do often end up returning to the space tramp. This suggests that visits to home planets among the crew members may not be a common occurrence.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the significance of the tramp constitution allowing crew members to visit their home planets?\n\nThe tramp constitution allowing crew members to visit their home planets is significant because it provides Stevie and Ammo the opportunity to return to their home planet and confront their past. It also sets the stage for the main conflict in the story, which revolves around their decision whether to stay on their home planet or return to the space tramp.\n\nThe fact that the tramp constitution allows crew members to visit their home planets is directly related to the main events of the story. It is because of this provision that Stevie and Ammo are able to return to their home planet, where they face their past and confront their future. Stevie's sister Onneli wants her to stay and take over the family business, while Ammo, after visiting his hibernating family, decides he wants to stay on the planet. This leads to a conflict between Stevie and Ammo, as Stevie had planned to return to the space tramp. The provision in the tramp constitution thus sets the stage for the main conflict in the story.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the tramp constitution's rule about home visits affect the crew's morale or commitment to their jobs?\n\nThe tramp constitution's rule about home visits seems to serve as a safety net for the crew members. It gives them the freedom to return home if they wish, which could potentially boost their morale and commitment to their jobs on the space tramp. However, the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the space tramp suggests that their experiences at home often reinforce their commitment to their jobs on the space tramp.\n\nThe rule about home visits is relevant to the story because it is the reason why Stevie and Ammo are able to visit their home planet. Their experiences during this visit, particularly Ammo's emotional reaction to seeing his hibernating family, highlight the challenges of returning home after a long absence. These challenges, combined with the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the space tramp, suggest that the rule about home visits often serves to reinforce crew members' commitment to their jobs on the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what happens if a crew member decides to stay on their home planet instead of returning to the space tramp?\n\nIf a crew member decides to stay on their home planet instead of returning to the space tramp, they might have to wait for a while before they can rejoin a space tramp. This is because these ships visit their system about once a year, if not less.\n\nThe fact that crew members might have to wait for a while before they can rejoin a space tramp if they decide to stay on their home planet is related to the story's plot. Stevie and Ammo are visiting their home planet, and Ammo decides to stay behind. This fact implies that if Ammo changes his mind and wants to return to the space tramp, he might have to wait for a while before he can do so.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the tramp constitution handle crew members who decide to stay on their home planet?\n\nThe tramp constitution allows crew members to visit their home planets and even stay there if they wish. However, if they decide to stay and later change their minds, they might have to wait for a long time before they can rejoin the crew, as the tramp only visits certain systems once a year or less.\n\nThis fact is significant in the story as it adds a layer of complexity to Stevie and Ammo's decision to visit their home planet. While they have the right to stay on their home planet, the potential wait time to rejoin the crew if they change their minds is a risk they have to consider. This is particularly relevant for Ammo, who after visiting his hibernating family, decides to stay on the planet, a decision that Stevie initially decides not to join him in. However, she later changes her mind and joins him, accepting the potential risk of a long wait if they decide to leave again.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the process for a crew member to visit their home planet?\n\nThe process for a crew member to visit their home planet involves scheduling time off from their duties on the space tramp. In the case of Stevie and Ammo, they had to arrange their shifts and responsibilities on the ship to accommodate their visit. The ship's resource manager, Ang Wong, mentions that it's mandatory for crew members to have the opportunity to visit their home planets, as it's written into the tramp constitution.\n\nThe fact that crew members are allowed to visit their home planets is a significant part of the story. It sets the stage for Stevie and Ammo's journey back to their home planet and the emotional turmoil they experience upon their return. The process of visiting their home planet also reveals the unique challenges and considerations of living and working on a space tramp, such as the time difference in space and the potential risk of crew members not returning to the ship.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the frequency of tramp visits to a system affect a crew member's decision to stay on their home planet?\n\nThe frequency of tramp visits to a system can potentially discourage a crew member from deciding to stay on their home planet. If they change their mind and want to return to the tramp, they might have to wait for a long time, possibly a year or more, before they can do so.\n\nThe fact that tramp visits to a system are infrequent is a significant consideration for crew members like Stevie and Ammo. If they decide to stay on their home planet and later regret their decision, they would have to wait for a considerable amount of time before they can rejoin a tramp. This is because tramps only visit a system about once a year or less. This fact is particularly relevant in the context of the story, as Ammo decides to stay on his home planet, while Stevie initially plans to leave without him. The possibility of a long wait before they can rejoin a tramp might have influenced their decisions.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, are there any restrictions or conditions for crew members who wish to visit their home planets?\n\nNo, there are no explicit restrictions or conditions mentioned for crew members who wish to visit their home planets. It is a right written into the tramp constitution and is mandatory.\n\nThe fact that crew members are allowed to visit their home planets is a significant part of the story. It allows Stevie and Ammo to return to their home planet after many years away. This visit stirs up old feelings and leads to a change in their plans. Ammo decides to stay on the planet, and after initially planning to leave without him, Stevie changes her mind and decides to stay as well. The fact that they are allowed to visit their home planets without restrictions or conditions enables these events to unfold.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the tramp constitution's rule about home visits impact the story's plot or the characters' decisions?\n\nThe tramp constitution's rule about home visits significantly impacts the story's plot and the characters' decisions. It allows Stevie and Ammo to return to their home planet, which sets the entire plot in motion. The visit home leads to Ammo deciding to stay on the planet permanently, while Stevie initially plans to leave without him. However, she eventually changes her mind and decides to stay with Ammo.\n\nThe tramp constitution's rule about home visits is a key factor that enables the main events of the story to occur. Without this rule, Stevie and Ammo would not have been able to return home, and the emotional journey and decisions that result from this visit would not have taken place. The rule also adds a layer of tension to the story, as there is a risk that crew members who visit home may not return to the space tramp. This is reflected in Ammo's decision to stay on the planet, and in Stevie's initial decision to leave without him.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why do most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship?\n\nMost crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship because they originally signed up for the space tramp to escape their home lives. The idea of returning home is often more appealing than the reality, and they find that it doesn't work out.\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship is related to the reasons why they left in the first place. In Stevie's case, she left her home planet to escape her parents' rigidity and the stifling small-town life. When crew members return home, they often find that the issues that made them leave are still present, leading them to return to the space tramp. This is also reflected in Ammo's decision to stay on the planet after visiting his hibernating family, which causes tension between him and Stevie.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the significance of the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship?\n\nThe significance of the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship is that it foreshadows the potential difficulties Stevie and Ammo might face if they decide to stay on their home planet.\n\nThe fact that most crew members return to the ship after trying to stay on their home planets suggests that adjusting to life back home after being away for a long time can be challenging. This is relevant to Stevie and Ammo's situation, as Ammo decides to stay on the planet, causing a disagreement with Stevie. The fact also serves as a warning to Stevie about the potential difficulties she might face if she decides to stay with Ammo, which is eventually what she does. It also adds a layer of uncertainty and tension to the story, as it is unclear whether Stevie and Ammo's decision to stay on the planet will work out in the long run.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship affect Stevie's decision to leave?\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship does not directly affect Stevie's decision to leave. She decides to leave without Ammo as planned after their argument, not because of the likelihood of returning to the ship.\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship is mentioned by the ship's resource manager, Ang Wong, during a conversation with Stevie. However, this fact does not seem to influence Stevie's decision to leave. Her decision to leave is primarily driven by her argument with Ammo and his decision to stay on the planet without discussing it with her. The fact about the crew members returning to the ship might have been intended to provide Stevie with some perspective or reassurance about her decision, but it does not directly affect her decision.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship influence Ammo's decision to stay?\n\nNo, the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship does not influence Ammo's decision to stay.\n\nAmmo's decision to stay on the planet is influenced by his emotional response to seeing his family again, not by the statistics of crew members returning to the ship. Despite knowing that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship, Ammo still chooses to stay. This suggests that his decision is based on personal feelings and desires, rather than the likelihood of his decision being successful.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship reveal about life on the space tramp?\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship reveals that life on the space tramp, despite its challenges, may be more appealing or suitable to them than life on their home planets.\n\nThe story suggests that many crew members, like Stevie, initially leave their home planets due to dissatisfaction with their lives there. Ang Wong's comment implies that these individuals often find that their home planets have not changed in the ways they had hoped, leading them to return to the space tramp. This is further supported by the example of Gar Han Wang, who returned to the ship after only two months on their home planet. In Stevie's case, she left her home planet due to her parents' rigidity and the stifling small-town life. Her decision to return for a visit, and the uncertainty about whether she will stay, is a significant part of the story's conflict.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship impact the crew's morale?\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship likely has a mixed impact on the crew's morale. On one hand, it might be comforting to know that they have the option to return to the ship if their homecoming doesn't go as planned. On the other hand, it might also be disheartening to realize that their chances of successfully reintegrating into their home societies are relatively low.\n\nThe fact that most crew members end up returning to the ship after attempting to stay on their home planets is directly related to the crew's decision to work on the space tramp in the first place. As Ang Wong points out, those with a happy home life usually don't sign up for a space tramp. This suggests that many crew members, including Stevie and Ammo, may have left their home planets due to dissatisfaction with their lives there. Therefore, the fact that most crew members return to the ship after attempting to stay on their home planets reinforces the idea that the space tramp serves as a refuge for those who are unhappy or dissatisfied with their home lives.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship contribute to Stevie's initial reluctance to return home?\n\nNo, the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship does not contribute to Stevie's initial reluctance to return home.\n\nStevie's initial reluctance to return home is not related to the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship. Instead, her reluctance is due to her past experiences and the circumstances under which she left her home planet. She left her home planet suddenly without saying goodbye because she wanted to escape her parents' rigidity and the stifling small-town life on a backward planet. When she took a job on a starship, she did so with the idea that she would probably never see her home world again. Therefore, her reluctance to return home is more related to her personal history and the fear of confronting her past, rather than the likelihood of her returning to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship affect the crew's relationships with their families?\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship likely creates a sense of uncertainty and tension in the crew's relationships with their families. It can lead to difficult decisions and emotional turmoil, as seen in the case of Stevie and Ammo.\n\nThe fact that most crew members return to the ship after trying to stay on their home planets is directly related to the emotional struggles Stevie and Ammo face in the story. Ammo, after visiting his hibernating family, decides to stay on the planet, causing a rift between him and Stevie. Stevie, on the other hand, is torn between her desire to return to the space tramp and her sister's wish for her to stay and take over the family business. This fact underscores the difficult choices and emotional challenges that space tramp crew members face when they visit their home planets.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship reflect on the conditions of their home planets?\n\nNo, the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship does not necessarily reflect on the conditions of their home planets.\n\nThe story suggests that the reason most crew members return to the ship is not due to the conditions of their home planets, but rather due to their personal circumstances and choices. For instance, Stevie initially left her home planet to escape her parents' rigidity and the stifling small-town life. Similarly, Ammo's family is in hibernation during their visit, which could contribute to his emotional withdrawal and decision to stay. These personal factors, rather than the conditions of their home planets, seem to influence their decisions to leave or stay.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship shape the crew's perception of their home planets?\n\nThe fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the ship shapes the crew's perception of their home planets as places that are difficult to readjust to after being away for so long. It suggests that despite the nostalgia or longing they might feel for their home planets, the reality of living there again often doesn't meet their expectations.\n\nThis fact is relevant to the story as it foreshadows the challenges that Stevie and Ammo face when they visit their home planet. Despite their initial excitement and longing for home, they both struggle with their return. Ammo becomes emotionally withdrawn after visiting his hibernating family, and eventually decides to stay on the planet without discussing it with Stevie. Stevie, on the other hand, faces resistance from her family, particularly her sister Onneli, who is upset that Stevie left without saying goodbye and wants her to stay and take over the family business. These experiences reflect the difficulties that the crew members often face when trying to reintegrate into their home planets, as suggested by the fact shared by Ang Wong.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, who is Gar Han Wang?\n\nIn the story Estivation Troubles, Gar Han Wang is a crew member of the space tramp freighter who tried to stay on their home planet but decided to leave again after two months.\n\nThe fact about Gar Han Wang is used by Ang Wong to illustrate the point that crew members who try to stay on their home planets often end up returning to the space tramp. This is relevant to Stevie's situation, as she is about to visit her home planet and is considering whether or not to return to the space tramp afterwards. The story of Gar Han Wang serves as a cautionary tale, suggesting that Stevie might also find it difficult to readjust to life on her home planet after being away for so long.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why did Gar Han Wang decide to leave their home planet after two months?\n\nThe story does not provide a specific reason why Gar Han Wang decided to leave their home planet after two months.\n\nGar Han Wang's decision to leave their home planet after two months is used as an example to illustrate a common pattern among the space tramp crew members. Despite the mandatory option to return home, most crew members end up coming back to the ship, suggesting that their home planets may not provide the same sense of fulfillment or purpose as their life aboard the space tramp. This fact is relevant as it foreshadows the potential challenges that Stevie and Ammo might face in their decision to return home.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does Gar Han Wang's experience influence Stevie's decision to return home?\n\nGar Han Wang's experience does not directly influence Stevie's decision to return home, but it does provide her with a perspective on the potential challenges of readjusting to life on her home planet.\n\nGar Han Wang's experience is used as an example by Ang Wong to illustrate the difficulties that crew members might face when they try to reintegrate into their home societies after being away for a long time. This information might have made Stevie more aware of the potential difficulties she could face if she decided to stay on her home planet. However, it does not directly influence her decision to return home, as she had already made up her mind to visit her family.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the significance of Gar Han Wang's decision to leave their home planet?\n\nGar Han Wang's decision to leave their home planet after trying to stay is significant because it serves as a warning to Stevie and Ammo about the potential difficulties of readjusting to life on their home planet.\n\nGar Han Wang's experience is used by Ang Wong to illustrate the challenges that Stevie and Ammo might face in trying to reintegrate into their home planet's society. It suggests that the freedom and independence they have experienced as part of the space tramp's crew might make it difficult for them to settle back into the more structured and rigid life on their home planet. This is particularly relevant for Stevie, who originally left her home planet to escape its 'stultifying small-town life'. The mention of Gar Han Wang's decision also foreshadows the conflict that arises later in the story when Ammo decides to stay on the planet while Stevie plans to leave.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how often does a tramp visit the system where Gar Han Wang's home planet is located?\n\nA tramp visits the system where Gar Han Wang's home planet is located about once a year, if not less.\n\nThe frequency of tramp visits to the system where Gar Han Wang's home planet is located is relevant because it highlights the potential consequences of a crew member's decision to stay on their home planet.

This fact also underscores the risk that Stevie and Ammo are taking by returning to their home planet.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what is the 'tramp constitution' that Ang Wong refers to?\n\nThe 'tramp constitution' that Ang Wong refers to is a set of rules or guidelines for the crew members of the space tramp freighter. One of the provisions in this constitution allows crew members to return to their home planets if they wish to do so.\n\nThe 'tramp constitution' is significant in the story as it provides Stevie and Ammo the opportunity to return home. It is mentioned that the chance of crew members not returning after visiting their home planets is quite high, around eighty-twenty. However, the constitution still allows them this choice, with the understanding that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets eventually decide to leave again, as was the case with Gar Han Wang. This fact is relevant as it sets the stage for the emotional conflict Stevie and Ammo face when they visit their families and consider whether to stay or return to the space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the tramp constitution affect the crew members' decisions to return home?\n\nThe tramp constitution affects the crew members' decisions to return home by giving them the freedom to do so.

However, the constitution also acknowledges the reality that most crew members may not choose to stay home once they return, as evidenced by the case of Gar Han Wang, who decided to leave their home planet again after just two months.\n\nThe tramp constitution plays a significant role in the story as it provides the crew members with the option to return home, which is a major decision for Stevie and Ammo. The fact that Gar Han Wang, a fellow crew member, tried to stay on their home planet but decided to leave again after two months, serves as a cautionary tale for Stevie and Ammo. It highlights the potential difficulties and emotional complexities of returning home after a long period of absence, and the possibility that the home they remember may not be the same anymore.

The statement by Ang Wong highlights the psychological comfort that the option to return home provides to the crew members, even if they don't exercise that option.

If a crew member decides to stay on their home planet but then changes their mind, they may have to wait a long time for another space tramp to arrive. This could potentially leave them stranded on their home planet for a year or more.\n\nThe fact that Gar Han Wang decided to leave their home planet again after only two months shows that the decision to stay is not always permanent. However, the infrequent visits of the space tramp mean that changing one's mind can result in a long wait. This adds a layer of complexity and risk to the decision to stay on one's home planet, as it is not simply a matter of choosing where one wants to be, but also of committing to that choice for potentially a long time.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does Stevie react to Ang Wong's information about the likelihood of crew members returning to the space tramp?\n\nStevie does not express a specific reaction to Ang Wong's information about the likelihood of crew members returning to the space tramp.

The fact that most crew members who try to stay on their home planets end up returning to the space tramp, as exemplified by Gar Han Wang, might influence Stevie's decision about whether to stay on her home planet or return to the space tramp. However, the story does not provide a specific reaction from Stevie to this information.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the infrequency of space tramp visits to Stevie's home system affect her decision to leave?\n\nThe infrequency of space tramp visits to Stevie's home system makes her decision to leave more significant and risky. If she decides to stay on her home planet and later changes her mind, she might have to wait a long time before she can leave again.\n\nThe fact that space tramp visits to Stevie's home system are infrequent adds a layer of complexity to her decision to leave. It means that her decision is not easily reversible. If she decides to stay on her home planet and later regrets it, she might have to wait a year or more before she can leave again.

It adds a layer of complexity and risk to their decision to visit home and potentially stay there. If they decide to stay and later regret it, they would have to wait for a potentially long time before they could leave again. This fact is likely one of the reasons why most crew members decide to return to the ship after visiting home, as mentioned by Ang Wong.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the infrequency of space tramp visits contribute to the isolation of Stevie's home planet?\n\nThe infrequency of space tramp visits contributes to the isolation of Stevie's home planet by making it difficult for its inhabitants to leave or for others to visit. It also means that if Stevie and Ammo decide to stay on the planet but then change their minds, they might have to wait a long time for another space tramp to come by.\n\nThe fact that space tramp visits are infrequent is relevant to the story because it underscores the isolation of Stevie's home planet and the commitment involved in deciding to stay there. It also adds tension to Stevie and Ammo's decision to visit their families, as they know that if they decide to stay but then change their minds, they might be stuck on the planet for a long time.

However, this does not seem to directly influence her decision. She initially plans to leave as scheduled, despite Ammo's decision to stay. It is only at the last minute that she changes her mind and decides to stay with Ammo, indicating that her decision is influenced more by her relationship with Ammo than the potential wait for the next space tramp.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the infrequency of space tramp visits impact the culture and lifestyle of the people on Stevie's home planet?\n\nThe infrequency of space tramp visits to Stevie's home planet does not directly impact the culture and lifestyle of the people there. However, it does affect the decisions and experiences of the crew members who decide to stay on the planet.\n\nThe infrequency of space tramp visits means that if a crew member decides to stay on the planet and later changes their mind, they might have to wait for a long time before they can leave again. This is mentioned in the story when Ang Wong tells Stevie about Gar Han Wang, a crew member who decided to leave again after only two months on the planet but had to wait for the next ship. This fact might have influenced Stevie's decision to stay on the planet with Ammo at the end of the story, knowing that if she changed her mind, she might not be able to leave for a long time.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the fact that space tramps only visit once a year or less affect the economy of Stevie's home planet?\n\nThe story does not provide specific details on how the infrequent visits from space tramps affect the economy of Stevie's home planet.\n\nThe fact that space tramps only visit Stevie's home planet once a year or less is mentioned in the context of the potential consequences for Stevie and Ammo if they decide to stay on their home planet.

Initially, she saw the difference between estivating and hibernating populations as just how the world was. However, after meeting Ammo, who always looked further and deeper than she did, she began to question why the terraformers split the human population into two and if the divide really needed to be that sharp.\n\nStevie's questioning of the division is triggered by her husband Ammo's decision to stay behind on the planet.

The 'Winters' are awake during the winter months, while the 'Summers' are in hibernation.\n\nThe fact that Stevie's family is awake during the winter while Ammo's family is deep asleep is a result of the terraformers' social experiment. This experiment divided the human population into two groups, 'Winters' and 'Summers', who have different sleep and wake cycles. This division has caused a cultural adaptation where the 'Winters' are awake during the winter months and the 'Summers' hibernate. This fact is significant as it affects the timing of Stevie and Ammo's visit to their families, with Stevie being able to interact with her family while Ammo can only visit his sleeping family.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the sleeping pattern of Stevie's and Ammo's families affect their visit?\n\nThe sleeping pattern of Stevie's and Ammo's families affects their visit in a way that Stevie is able to interact with her family who are awake, while Ammo's family is in deep sleep due to their hibernation period in winter. This leads to Ammo visiting his family alone and coming back very emotional, and eventually deciding to stay on the planet.\n\nThe difference in sleeping patterns between Stevie's and Ammo's families is a significant factor in the story.

The 'Winters' are awake during the winter, while the 'Summers' hibernate during this period.\n\nThe cultural significance of the sleeping patterns is highlighted throughout the story. For instance, when Stevie and Ammo visit their families, they have to navigate this cultural divide. Stevie's family is awake and able to interact with her, while Ammo's family is in deep sleep, making it impossible for him to communicate with them. This difference in sleeping patterns also influences the design of their homes, with 'Winter' homes being shorter and squatter, and 'Summer' homes being painted dark blue with signs warning of hibernating families.

As they are awake during the winter, this is the time she can visit and communicate with them. However, this also means that she cannot spend time with Ammo's family, who are asleep during this period.\n\nThe difference in sleeping patterns between the Winters and Summers creates a divide in the society and in Stevie's personal life. It affects her relationship with her family as it dictates when she can see them. It also impacts her relationship with Ammo, as they cannot visit both families together due to the differing sleep cycles.

Therefore, the sleeping pattern of Ammo's family not only influences his relationship with them, but also his relationship with Stevie and his decision to stay on the planet.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the difference in sleeping patterns between Stevie's and Ammo's families reflect the broader societal divisions on their planet?\n\nThe difference in sleeping patterns between Stevie's and Ammo's families reflects the broader societal divisions on their planet by showing how the human population was split into two distinct groups by the terraformers. These groups, known as Winters and Summers, have different hibernation and estivation patterns, which affect their lifestyles and interactions. The Winters, like Stevie's family, are awake during the winter, while the Summers, like Ammo's family, are deep asleep during this time. This division is so ingrained in their society that it even affects the layout of their neighborhoods, with houses of hibernating and estivating families being distinctly different and usually separated into different wards.\n\nThe fact that Stevie's family is awake during the winter while Ammo's family is deep asleep is a direct result of the societal divisions created by the terraformers. This division is not just a simple difference in sleeping patterns, but a fundamental aspect of their society that affects their daily lives, interactions, and even the layout of their neighborhoods. It also creates challenges for Stevie and Ammo, as they have to navigate these differences and their implications during their visit. For instance, Ammo has to visit his sleeping family alone, and Stevie has to deal with the expectations of her awake family. This fact is therefore closely related to the broader theme of societal divisions and their impacts in the story.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why is Stevie unsure of the time of day in her old neighborhood?\n\nStevie is unsure of the time of day in her old neighborhood because she has been away for a long time and is no longer accustomed to the local indicators of time, such as the level of activity and the lighting in the houses.\n\nStevie's uncertainty about the time of day is a result of her long absence from her home planet. She has been living aboard a space tramp freighter, where the indicators of time are likely different from those on her home planet.

Her family is awake during her visit, and they are able to interact regardless of the time of day.

Her confusion about the time of day is a small, but significant, part of her larger struggle to reconnect with her past and understand her place in the world.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does Stevie's uncertainty about the time of day symbolize her uncertainty about her place in this world?\n\nYes, Stevie's uncertainty about the time of day symbolizes her uncertainty about her place in this world.\n\nStevie's uncertainty about the time of day when she arrives at her old neighborhood reflects her disorientation and unfamiliarity with her old surroundings.

This is important in the society Stevie and Ammo come from, where the human population is divided into two groups based on their sleep cycles. The dark blue houses indicate that the families inside are hibernating, and signs on the doors warn others not to disturb them. This color coding helps maintain the societal structure and respect for the different sleep cycles.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, what does the color white signify for the houses?\n\nIn the story, the color white signifies that the inhabitants of the house are estivating families.\n\nThe color of the houses is a visual representation of the cultural adaptation of the human population on Stevie's home planet.

Her quick dismissal of her own anger and the troubles with the Summers suggests a level of apathy or dismissiveness towards the issues between the two groups. This could indicate that the Winters generally prefer to keep to themselves and avoid getting involved in the troubles with the Summers, despite any underlying prejudices they may have.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does Onneli's comment about the Summers influence Stevie's decision to leave without Ammo?\n\nNo, Onneli's comment about the Summers does not influence Stevie's decision to leave without Ammo.\n\nStevie's decision to leave without Ammo is influenced by Ammo's decision to stay on the planet after visiting his family, not Onneli's comment about the Summers. Stevie is upset that Ammo did not discuss his decision with her and decides to leave without him as planned. Onneli's comment about the Summers is a separate issue and does not directly influence Stevie's decision.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the ongoing trouble with the Summers contribute to Ammo's decision to stay on the planet?\n\nThe story does not explicitly state that the ongoing troubles with the Summers contribute to Ammo's decision to stay on the planet.\n\nAmmo's decision to stay on the planet is primarily influenced by his emotional visit to his hibernating family.

The troubles seem to be a longstanding issue on the planet, but they do not appear to directly impact Ammo's personal decision.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the tension between the Winters and Summers affect Stevie and Ammo's relationship?\n\nThe tension between the Winters and Summers affects Stevie and Ammo's relationship by causing misunderstandings and conflicts. Onneli initially assumes that Stevie left their home planet because she was having an affair with a Summer, which is not true. Later, Ammo decides to stay on the planet without discussing it with Stevie, which leads to an argument between them.\n\nThe cultural tension between Winters and Summers is a significant factor in the story. It leads to Onneli's misunderstanding about Stevie's reasons for leaving and her skepticism about Ammo. This tension also indirectly contributes to Ammo's decision to stay on the planet, which causes a rift between him and Stevie. Therefore, the tension between the Winters and Summers has a direct impact on Stevie and Ammo's relationship.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does Onneli's dismissive attitude towards the Summers reflect her personal feelings or the societal norms?\n\nOnneli's dismissive attitude towards the Summers seems to reflect societal norms rather than her personal feelings.\n\nOnneli's initial reaction to Ammo being a Summer suggests that there is a societal norm or expectation for Winters and Summers to remain separate or have conflicts. However, her quick dismissal of her own question and statement that the troubles with Summers have nothing to do with them suggests that she personally does not hold strong negative feelings towards Summers. Instead, she seems to view the troubles as a societal issue that is out of their control.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does the conflict between the Winters and Summers impact Stevie's return home?\n\nThe conflict between the Winters and Summers adds a layer of tension to Stevie's return home. It causes her sister Onneli to react with suspicion and hostility towards Ammo, Stevie's husband, who is a Summer. This conflict also leads to misunderstandings and assumptions, as Onneli initially believes that Stevie left because she was having an affair with a Summer.\n\nThe fact that there are always troubles with the Summers, as confirmed by Onneli, indicates that there is a longstanding conflict or tension between the two groups. This conflict impacts Stevie's return home by causing her sister to react negatively towards her husband Ammo, who is a Summer. It also leads to Onneli making assumptions about why Stevie left, suggesting that the conflict between the Winters and Summers is a significant issue on their planet.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does the constant trouble with the Summers affect Stevie's perception of her own identity as a Winter?\n\nThe story does not provide enough information to definitively say whether the constant trouble with the Summers affects Stevie's perception of her own identity as a Winter.\n\nWhile the story mentions that there are always troubles with the Summers, it does not elaborate on what these troubles are or how they might affect Stevie's perception of her own identity. Stevie does not express any discomfort or conflict about her identity as a Winter or her marriage to a Summer.

This suggests that Stevie does not see a conflict between her identity as a Winter and her relationship with a Summer.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, why does Onneli refer to herself as the elder sister?\n\nOnneli refers to herself as the elder sister because Stevie, her younger sister, has been away for a long time and Onneli has grown older in her absence.\n\nThe fact that Onneli refers to herself as the elder sister is significant because it highlights the passage of time and the changes that have occurred while Stevie was away. It also underscores the role reversal that has taken place, with Onneli now being the older, more responsible sibling in contrast to Stevie's younger, more adventurous character.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, how does Onneli's status as the elder sister affect her relationship with Stevie?\n\nOnneli's status as the elder sister seems to give her a sense of authority and responsibility over Stevie.

She quickly dismisses her own suspicion about Stevie having an affair with a Summer, suggesting that her concern is more about the potential for conflict between the two groups. While Onneli does refer to herself as the elder sister, this seems to be more of a playful comment about their age difference, rather than a statement about her authority or influence over Stevie's decisions.", "In the story Estivation Troubles, does Onneli use her position as the elder sister to try and persuade Stevie to stay?\n\nYes, Onneli uses her position as the elder sister to try and persuade Stevie to stay.\n\nOnneli's position as the elder sister is highlighted when she refers to herself as 'the elder now'.
